# ☝️ Code of Conduct

This document describes the ethical standards behind which the people who develop this software operate.


## ✋ Pledge

With the goal of fostering an environment that's open, inclusive, and completely non-prejudicial, we as the developers, contributors, and maintainers of this software undertake to make participation in this project free of harassment for everyone regardless of age, disability, ethnicity, race, body, gender identity and expression, education, level of experience, nationality, physical appearance, sexual identity and orientation, belief system or religion.


## 📖 Standards of Behavior

Enumerating the standards to which we adhere and require of participants is difficult, and so we give the following examples of behavior that promote positivity and further the pledge:

-   Using welcoming and inclusive language
-   Respecting viewpoints, cultural reference bases, and personal experiences
-   Accepting criticism gracefully when it's given constructively
-   Concentrating on the diversity and health of the community first, the code second
-   Practicing genuine empathy and thoughtfulness towards every member

Examples of unacceptable behavior include but are not limited to:

-   Using sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
-   Criticizing for the purpose of "trolling", insulting, making derogatory comments, or attacking the personal or political beliefs of others
-   Harassing in private or in public
-   Revealing others' private information, such as physical addresses and locations, private email addresses, and so forth, without prior express permission
-   Any other conduct that may be considered inappropriate in a professional setting


## ✊ Responsibilities

The project maintainers bear the responsibility for clarifying these standards and are expected to take fair and corrective action in response to instances of unacceptable behavior. The project maintainers have the right to remove, modify, or reject any contribution to the project whether in the form of comment, wiki change, pull request, code commit, discussion, and so forth, that are not in keeping with the spirit of values expected of the community. Repeat violators of the code of conduct may be muted, temporarily or permanently removed.


## 🗺 Scope

This code of conduct applies not only to the visible project spaces within which progress is made on this code but also to other public and private spaces that involve the developers, contributors, and maintainers of the project. This includes and is not limited to public social media posting, private direct messages, email, discussion areas, message boards, and so on. In these and other venues, the project continues to be represented and the code of conduct still applies.
